# Genetic GPU

Genetic GPU is a non-convex optimization algorithm that uses WebGL to optimize user-inputted functions. It parallelizes both on the GPU and across the network (by making use of multiple GPUs at once).

## Project Writeup

A detailed writeup of the algorithm (compiled for ME202 at UC Berkeley) is available [here](http://petercottle.com/GGPUwriteup.pdf).

## Demo

A hosted interface for the demo is available [here](http://petercottle.com/GeneticGPU/index.html) (webkit only). Note that once the window location gets a room ID appended to it, you can share that link with a friend to divide up the search space and parallelize your optimization.
